Some time ago I made a tutorial that taught how to create a never-ending, cascading fountain of lady bugs using the 
HTML/CSS/JS([P5.js library](https://p5js.org/)). The bugs appeared from the bottom of an HTML5 canvas, each having its own horizontal and vertical 
velocities and angle in the vertical direction. They were affected by gravity so moved in an arc. They always pointed in the 
direction of travel so turned at the top of the arc. When they reached the bottom of the canvas they repeated their travel.
Hence they formed a never-ending cascade.

I negligently deleted the repl on [replit](https://repl.it) that contained the starter files. Today I fixed this by creating a new repl - see links below:
